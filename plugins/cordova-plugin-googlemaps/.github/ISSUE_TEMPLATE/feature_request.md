Although this plugin is open source, please consider to donation some amount, because "time is money".
If you ask a small feature, such as adding some options for an existing method, this project doesn't ask any donation.
But if you ask a big feature, such as adding "directions", "streetview",...etc, this project probably ask some amount donation.

So far, HTMLInfoWindow and MarkerCluster are the donated project.
